In my time as a software engineer I have developed many new features and products for users from start to finish. I have years of experience on both frontend and backend frameworks and coding languages. Having worked remotely for the majority of my career, I have proven that I am a self-starter and independent worker.
<br><br>
With my degree in Computer Science I bring a background of design principles, algorithms, and a passion for learning new things.
<br><br>
Here are some of my accomplishments from the last company I worked for:
<br><br>
- Created a new tiered pricing structure with relevant database schema and code changes that allowed the company’s subscribers to bill their customers based on the area being serviced.
<br><br>
- Created a newer, sleeker, frontend UI for the company’s onboarding tool. This included developing new services that connected with AWS EC2 and Redis to update the status of the onboarding process for the onboarding team. This helped reduce the onboarding time for new customers from 90+ days down to 60 days.
<br><br>
Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.
